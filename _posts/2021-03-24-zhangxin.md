# The Impact of Exposure to Heat Waves on Cognitive Performance

This paper examines the effect of transitory exposure to heat waves on cognitive performance by matching a nationally representative longitudinal survey in China with weather and climate data according to the exact time and geographic location of the cognitive tests. When respondents were tested on hot days (>85°F), their test scores dropped significantly. The negative effect was more pronounced for women and the older cohort, in particular for verbal tests. People who lived in the north or did not have air conditioning (AC) installed in their homes at the time of test were vulnerable to high temperatures, while those who lived in the south or who did have AC were not, indicating the existence of adaptation. The hidden cost of climate change on cognitive performance should be recognized in the assessment of climate policy.
