# Economic Analysis of Energy Storage Application of Retired Electric Vehicle Batteries

In the context of combating global warming, electric vehicles have been increasingly seen as one of the important paths to achieve low-carbon transformation in the transportation industry. China was one of the first countries in the world to start promoting electric vehicles on a large scale, and with the introduction of a series of massive subsidies, electric vehicle sales have grown significantly. A direct consequence of the large number of electric vehicles on the road is an increase in the number of end-of-life batteries when they reach the end of their useful life. The increasing number of discarded batteries raises further questions: can these batteries be and how can they be disposed of, recycled or reused? Based on this, this paper investigates the economic feasibility of using used EV batteries in energy storage systems in China and analyzes under what conditions such secondary use can be profitable. The results of the study show that recycling of used EV batteries for energy storage systems at 80% of remaining capacity and scrapping them at 50% of remaining capacity can achieve a utilization value of 785 RMB/kWh (116 USD/kWh) (the cost of used batteries is assumed to be zero at this point). This benefit is reduced when the cost of acquiring used batteries is taken into account. Since the market for used batteries has not yet been formed, this paper further explores the valuation of used batteries and gives a reasonable valuation range, i.e., between the lower limit of the "willing to sell" price for EV users and the "market assessment" based on the condition of the batteries. The study found that the remaining capacity of the old battery was not sufficient to cover the remaining capacity of the battery. It is found that the use of used batteries in energy storage systems at less than 87% of their remaining capacity can achieve Pareto improvements from a social welfare perspective. In addition, we estimate that the optimal retired residual capacity of old batteries when retired for use in energy storage systems is 77%.
