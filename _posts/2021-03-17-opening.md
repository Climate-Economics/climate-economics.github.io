# Round Table on Climate Change Economics

## About the Forum

With global warming and extreme weather events, climate change is becoming more and more "everyday" and an important issue in our lives.
In 2020, China announced that it will achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, making a significant contribution to the global goal of controlling temperature rise, and the issue of climate change has been raised to an unprecedented level.

As climate change affects both natural and social systems, cross-collaboration between natural and social sciences is crucial in addressing climate change. Climate Change Economics has emerged as a cross-cutting field and has been able to develop rapidly. In 2018, climate change economist William Nordhaus was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, and this emerging discipline has gained wider attention and recognition.

Climate Change Economics has ushered in new opportunities for development, and at the same time will take on a more difficult responsibility. These opportunities and responsibilities require us to make a greater contribution to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. To this end, we have launched the "Climate Change Economics Forum" to provide a platform for researchers, policy makers, industry practitioners and the public to learn, exchange, showcase themselves and cooperate for mutual benefit.
